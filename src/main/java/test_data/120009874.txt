Database creation
- Correct table definitions
- Correct fields
- You should really use the same attribute names as in the provided relational model (but this isn't a big problem)
- Appropriate choice of types
- Some missing primary keys
- Good foreign key constraints, though not completely ideal
- Remember, one foreign key constraint can include several attributes: league_player(league_name, league_year) references league(name, year) is a better constraint than the 2 separate ones you've included
- Why not have a single FOREIGN KEY (court_number, venue_name) in played_match?
- match_played should be played_match

SQL queries
- view_win_count working correctly, but should be sorted by email
- view_win_count isn't quite right: we want *matches* won, not *games* won
- view_contact_details working correctly, implemented as a view, with correct columns and rows

Constraints
- No attempt at any of the stated constraints

Procedure
- No attempt at proc_add_venue

GUI
- No attempt

Report
- Clear summary of functionality
- No compilation and usage instructions
- A little brief, not discussing missing features much - remember, there's some credit for showing understanding of advanced concepts!

Overall comments
- A coding practical containing code achieving some of the required functionality, adequately documented or reported.
- Please see me if you're having problems understanding the course.
