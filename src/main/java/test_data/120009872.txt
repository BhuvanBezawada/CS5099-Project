Database creation
- Correct table definitions
- Correct fields
- Appropriate choice of types
- Correct primary keys
- Correct foreign key constraints
- Nice use of AUTO_INCREMENT for artificial ID
- Nice use of delete/update actions
- FOREIGN KEY (`p1_email`, `league_name`, `league_year`) REFERENCES `league_player` is a nice touch, handling an additional constraint elegantly

SQL queries
- view_never_played working correctly, implemented as a view, with correct columns and rows
- view_win_count working correctly, implemented as a view, with correct columns and rows
- view_contact_details working correctly, implemented as a view, with correct columns and rows
- Appropriate extra views for the GUI

Constraints

- Email address format checked correctly
- Matches are validated with respect to scores, league years, and valid players

Procedure
- proc_add_venue included and working correctly
- Negative number of courts throws an error as expected

- Almost no typing required, making things easy for the user at every step!
- Good problem-specific inputs: dropdowns for leagues etc.
- Superb error checking

Report
- Clear compilation and usage instructions
- Good summary of functionality
- Extensions and interesting features explained well
- Nice explanation of your tables and queries
- Appropriate output shown in the form of screenshots
- Your class UML diagram is particularly nice

- Several extra views showing good understanding and providing nice functionality

Overall comments
- A coding practical containing code achieving all specified functionality plus appropriate exceptional features, with unusual clarity of design and implementation, together with an outstandingly well-written report showing evidence of extensive background reading, a full knowledge of the subject and insight into the problem.
