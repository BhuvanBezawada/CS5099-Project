Database creation
- Correct table definitions
- Correct fields
- Appropriate choice of types
- Correct primary keys
- Correct foreign key constraints
- Nice use of AUTO_INCREMENT for artificial ID
- Nice use of delete/update actions
- Why not have a single FOREIGN KEY (court_number, venue_name) in played_match?
- match_played should be played_match

SQL queries
- view_never_played working correctly, implemented as a view, with correct columns and rows
- view_win_count working correctly, implemented as a view, with correct columns and rows
- view_contact_details implemented, but phone numbers are not grouped up and comma-separated as they should be

Constraints
- phone_type constrained to the correct 3 values
- Email address format checked correctly
- Matches are validated with respect to scores and league years
- Missing constraint: It should not be possible to create a match including a player that is not in the specified league

Procedure
- proc_add_venue included and working correctly
- Negative number of courts throws an error as expected

GUI
- Java used
- Compiles and runs correctly
- Code is neat and easy to follow
- Seeing all matches from a league: data presented clearly, with appropriate columns and good look-and-feel
- Almost no typing required, making things easy for the user at every step!
- Good problem-specific inputs: dropdowns for leagues etc.
- Superb error checking

Report
- Clear compilation and usage instructions
- Good summary of functionality
- Extensions and interesting features explained well
- Nice explanation of your tables and queries
- Appropriate output shown in the form of screenshots
- Please avoid screenshots of your program code
- Screenshots of your GUI running would be good
- Rather long at over 3100 words; more detail than needed

Overall comments
- A coding practical containing clear, well-designed code achieving full required functionality, although no extension elements, written in good style, together with a clear and well-written report showing real insight into the subject matter.
